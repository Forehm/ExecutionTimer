# Execution Timer
It is a timer of execution time of the any program.
It requires C++14 or later and x86
You just need to create an object of the class Timer;
then when yo need an execution time, you call a function get_execution_time(); it returns string to be more convenient;
some new features will be added soon...
You can find the better timer in cpp_search_server.
